# Can Satellite System Design

A can satellite (CanSat) is a miniature satellite system that can fit inside a soda can. CanSats are commonly used in the academe as an introduction to space science and technology applications. In this research, the CanSat and its flight simulations were used as an instrument for atmospheric data observation.

### Overview
The following are the objectives to be addressed in the project:
- maintain sufficient power supply during a 150-minute operation period
- establish reliable transmission of atmospheric data within 50 km of the CanSat
- simulate 120 minutes of sensor readings and encapsulate data into packets
- design a secondary mission and discuss its implications on CanSat operations

For more information, see the [documentation](https://github.com/bluaxees/cansat/blob/main/documentation.pdf).

### File Structure
The `project` directory should contain the microcontroller application for Digital Application Virtual Engineer (DAVE Infineon) software. Schematics used for flight simulations are available at the `schematic` directory.
